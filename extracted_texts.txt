People Over 40
Should Only Work 3
Days a Week, Experts
Say

BY MAYA
FEBRUARY 5, 2018

A study issued in the Melbourne
Institute Worker Paper claims
that people who are older than 40
performed best at work when
they worked three days per week.
So, does this mean that older
workers could work less
efficiently?

According to the Australian study,
researchers tried to analyze the
cognitive abilities of older
workers. As a result, the
participants in the study, 3,500
women and 3,000 men, took part

Climate change is the greatest
environmental threat facing the planet.

Since the industrial revolution to today,
the burning of fossil fuels (oi, coal and
‘g03), which are used to produce energy,
releases greenhouse gases (COa) into
the atmosphere, increasing the
temperature of the Earth and causing a
distortion in the global climate system.
